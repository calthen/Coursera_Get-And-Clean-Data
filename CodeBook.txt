Starts with the dataset specified by the project instructions

The Readme associated with the original dataset describes 561 measurements split into test and training sets.  
The run_analysis.R script first read in these datasets, applying descriptive names at the time of loading.
The script then merges the train and test sets to a single set
Next the measurements with 'mean' or 'std' in the label are selected (discarding the rest)
Also the readable activity names are applied to each measurement, replacing the activity_id
The data is finally reshaped to provide a format that is easily summarized and saved in the requested format.
